        <h1>Tel-Aviv District</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The Tel Aviv District is one of the seven districts of the State of Israel.
                <br>The district borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Central District to the north, south,
                and east.
                Its capital and largest city is Tel Aviv-Yafo. The district has one sub-district, the Tel Aviv
                Sub-district, which covers the same area as the district. The sub-district is divided into three natural
                regions: Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, and Holon. The division of land use in the Tel Aviv District is roughly as
                follows: 64.2% built-up area, 12% agriculture, and 21% land, shrubs, rocks, and excavated land. The
                distribution of land use in the built-up area is roughly as follows: 62% residential, 14% public and
                community areas, 13% commercial and office space, 8% infrastructure and transportation, and 3% industry.
