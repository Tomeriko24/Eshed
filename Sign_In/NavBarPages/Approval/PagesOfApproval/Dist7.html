        <h1>The Northern District</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The Northern District is one of the seven administrative districts of Israel.
                The district extends from the Golan Heights and Upper Galilee in the north to the Beit She'an Valley and
                Ramot Menashe in the south.
                Its capital is Nazareth, and the largest city in the district is also Nazareth. The district borders the
                Mediterranean Sea to the west, Lebanon to the north, Syria and Jordan to the east, and the Judean and
                Samarian hill country to the south.
                The size of the Northern District is 4,473 square kilometers. Many of the major tourism sites in Israel,
                including those around the Sea of Galilee and Mount Hermon, are located within the boundaries of the
                Northern District.
                The district also overlaps to some extent with the Galilee region in its broader sense, in addition to
                the Golan Heights.</p>
