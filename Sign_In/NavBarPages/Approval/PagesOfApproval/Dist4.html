        <h1>Judea and Samaria District</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Judea and Samaria District is an unofficial district managed by the Ministry of the Interior in addition
                to Israel's six official districts.
                The district is only responsible for the settlements in areas C of Judea and Samaria, which are not part
                of Israel but are under its control.
                The district manager in the Ministry of the Interior is also referred to as "the overseer of the Jewish
                settlements in Judea and Samaria" and "the manager of the Israeli settlements department in Judea and
                Samaria".
                The planning and construction in the district are under the authority of the Civil Administration's
                Higher Planning Council (Mata"a) in the Civilian Administration of the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
